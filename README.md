# Two-Pointer-Method
Two pointer method is mostly used for searching.

For example if we are given an array and told to find two numbers whose sum is equal to a targetted number, and will have to print the index number of those two numbers, in that case we will use this technique.

There are two types of two pointer method - i) opposite directional ii) equi directional

The code here is for the opposite direction.

**Time complexity of this method is o(n)**
